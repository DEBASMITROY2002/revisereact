Browser reads the HTML.
It creates a DOM tree. DOM: Document Object Model.
It renders the DOM tree.

DOM tree:
    ROOT NODE (TAGS)
        |
      CHILD NODES (NESTED TAGS)
        |
        CHILD NODES (NESTED TAGS)
        ...
        |
        LEAF NODES (TEXT)

AS UI Tech use interpreter to read the HTML and create the DOM tree.
