CSS ( Cascaded Style Sheet ) --------

3 Types of CSS Integration:
    1. Inline CSS
    2. Internal CSS
    3. External CSS

---- FAQ ----

1. Default height is auto to wrap the content. Eg. If there is no content, height is 0. 
2. Default width is 100% to take the full width of the parent container.
3. It is called Cascaded because the properties are applied from top to bottom. If there is a conflict, the last property is applied.
4. CSS Box: Content, Padding, Border, Margin.
5. The width refers to the content width. The padding, border, and margin are added to the width to get the total width. So the total width is width + padding + border + margin.
6. box-sizing: border-box; -> It includes padding and border in the width. So the total width is width + margin.
8. <meta> tag : It is read by the browser to understand the content of the page. Eg. <meta charset="UTF-8">, <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

-------------------- Inline CSS --------------------
    1. porperty-1: value;
    2. It is written inside the tag as Style. Eg. <div style="property-1: value; property-2: value;">


-------------------- Internal CSS --------------------
    1. <style> tag is used to write the CSS.
    2. It is written inside the head tag. It is a convention.
    3. It is applied to the whole page.
    4. Eg. 
        <style>
            selector {
                property-1: value;
                property-2: value;
            }
        </style>

        <head>
            ....
            <style>
                div {
                    background-color: red;
                    color: white;
                } ---> All div tags will have this style. Tag selector
                #idA {
                    background-color: blue;
                    color: white;
                } ---> All tags with id="idA" will have this style. ID selector
                *{
                    background-color: yellow;
                    color: black;
                } ---> All tags will have this style. Universal selector
                .ninja{
                    background-color: green;
                    color: white;
                } ---> All tags with class="ninja" will have this style. Class selector
            </style>
        </head>

So far the selectors are:
    1. Tag selector
    2. ID selector
    3. Universal selector
    4. Class selector

- Attribute selector -
    1. It is used to select tags with a specific attribute.
    2. Eg. 
        <style>
            [href]{
                color: red;
            } ---> All tags with href attribute will have this style.
            [href="https://www.google.com"]{
                color: blue;
            } ---> All tags with href="https://www.google.com" will have this style.
        </style>
    3. ^= -> Starts with , $= -> Ends with, *= -> Contains, != -> Not equal to ... are some of the operators used in attribute selector.
    4. example: [name^="a"] , [name$="a"] , [class *="ninja"] , [class !="ninja"] , [id = "idA"] ... any attribute can be used.





--------------------------------- External CSS ------------------------------

1. It is written in a separate file with .css extension.
2. It is linked to the HTML file using the link tag.
3. Connecting css with html : <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="notes_css.css">
4. Connecting css with another css file : @import url("notes_css.css");

html ------ link tag -------- css1 ----------- @ ------------ css2

5. When multiple css files are linked, the last css file is applied. So this is kind of union.




--------------------------------- Responsive CSS ------------------------------

To make compatible with all devices, we use responsive CSS depending on the screen size == viewport.
Responsive UI is the UI that adjusts according to the screen size.

@media tags for accomodating changes in different screen sizes.
smart phones: 320 x 480
tablets: 768 x 1024
laptops: 1024 x 768
...

Broswer is informed using the meta tag that the content has to adjusted as per the device width.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This has opened the POSSIBILITY of responsive design.
